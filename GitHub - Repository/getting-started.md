## Workflow
We are planning on having a main page with our some basic stats, and a secondary page where you can search a database with different criterias. A third page will be ranking kickers based on different criterias. The fourth page will be for calculating probabilty of success and victory.
## Tasks
Ben is going to mainly be working on the front end. John is going to do front end and backend. Aaron is doing backend and data entry. We will also all work together on some parts so everyone knows what's going on. 
## Branches
We will have a master branch and then a develop branch. When we want to add new features we will pull from the develop branch and we will test there. Once it's ready for production we will add it it the master branch. 
## Frameworks
We will be using Vue for the website, and we will also be incorporating a weather API for weather data. We will also be getting our data from a sports stats page (pro footbal reference). If we discover that we need more we will add as needed.
